<h2>NOTE.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE materials of heroism are everywhere;
each day and all situations
are full of them. The power to recognize
them and the will to use them
make the hero. He who saves life,
no matter how obscure, how poor, how
ignorant he may be, has a value which
can never belong to the spiller of blood;
and the crimson glories of war fade
before the white honors of peace.</div>

<p>This little story, which was originally
contributed to the "Youth's Companion,"
has sought to teach the young people
of America something of the grandeur
which waits upon a brave deed, and
something of the beauty of supreme
self-sacrifice.</p>

</div></td><td align='left'><div class='cap'>THE express from Columbia was due.
It was almost nine o'clock on Tuesday
night, the 31st of August, 1886. It
had been a hot day, sultry toward night,
and the loungers at the Summerville
station were divided between pitying
and envying their neighbors on the excursion
train. In such weather, home
seems either the most intolerable or the
most comfortable place in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
It had not rained for six weeks, and
South Carolina panted.</div>

<p>There was a larger crowd
than usual at the little station
to see the Columbia
excursionists come in. The
enterprise of the Summerville
merchant who placarded
the pine-trees of this
forest village with legends
to the effect that his ice-cream
would be found "Opp.
the depot," was well rewarded
that scorching night. The
streets thronged&mdash;if Summerville
streets can ever be
said to throng&mdash;with warm
and thirsty loungers of both sexes and
of every color. South Carolinians
though they were, they objected to the
heat of that day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<td align='left'><p>In the group at the station stood
a white boy, about ten years old,&mdash;a
neatly dressed, well-behaved little fellow,
with an expression of crushing
and delightful
responsibility.
He wandered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
back and forth restlessly and proudly
from the track to a tree in the square,
where an old horse and wagon were
fastened with unnecessary security.
The boy tested the halter, and patted
the horse continually.</p>

<p>It was a very important thing to drive
two miles in the dark for one's father
and bring him home from the nine
o'clock express. Add to this situation
the excitement of an excursion, and
Donny de Mone felt that life lacked
nothing more to the position and the
dignity of manhood. Besides, Donny
was very fond of his father, and had not
seen him for two weeks.

</div>

<p>Now, there was one curious thing
about this crowd which would have
been noticeable to a stranger, but had
not as yet attracted the attention of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
residents. This was the extraordinary
number of animals that seemed to be
waiting for this train. One would
have thought that half the dogs in the
neighborhood had relatives coming from
Columbia.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;STRAY GOATS AND MULES GAZED EXPECTANTLY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Stray goats and mules gazed
expectantly up and down the
track. Cats had followed
their owners from the
houses and betrayed their
devotion by subdued
squeals from under
their masters' regardless
heels. A
brindle-brown pig
wriggled its way
among the crowd,
grunting with persistent
uneasiness;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
while a couple of wandering cows, unmolested
by the strangely restless dogs,
passed and repassed the railroad crossing,
bellowing monotonously. The
horses at the station exhibited curious
discomfort; and Donny de Mone's
venerable nag "Ben Bow" astonished
the community by pulling at his
halter.</p>

<p>While the boy stood valiantly holding
the bridle, an old Negro came up and
pulled his sleeve. He was a shabby old
Negro. His lean knees protruded
through his trousers,&mdash;a mass of
patches from under which the original
material, like the jackknife in the mental
philosophy problem, had wholly disappeared.
It was especially noticeable
that tufts of white hair found their way
through the holes in his coon-skin cap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Across his shoulder he carried a bundle
knotted into an old red handkerchief
with a polka spot.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;AN OLD NEGRO CAME UP.&quot;</span>

<p>"Say, boss, cud ye tell me whar a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

whar my dahter, Juno Soo, is a
dyin' ob fever. She ain't long foh dis
wohl. I'se got money 'nuff foh de
breffust."</p>

<p>He looked wistfully at the lad.
Donny answered with the heartiness of
a child who has been brought up to
think of others.</p>

<p>"My father will tell you when he
comes in. I expect him every minute.
But why don't you go to Kittie's."
He mentioned the name of a woman
well known in Summerville for strong
character and wise benevolence. "She
lives up the track there. Anybody will
show you. She'll help you; she's the
best colored woman in town."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;HE PLODDED SLOWLY UP THE TRACK.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The old man turned away without
answering. Perhaps he thought this
a pleasant device on the boy's part to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
get rid of him. Perhaps he meant to
follow his counsel. Who can say? He
plodded slowly up the track and disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;SNAPPED HIS HALTER AND BROKE AWAY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<div class='cap'>NOW, while Donny stood holding
Ben Bow by the bridle, the old
horse reared, plunged violently, snapped
his halter, and
broke away.
The boy, at the same instant, was hurled
to the ground. The ringing of hoofs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and whir of wheels made strange sensations
in his ears. He thought what a
fool he was to be knocked down by old
Ben Bow.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;HE GOT DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND CRAWLED.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then he tottered to his feet. Complete
darkness had come. There was
an unearthly
silence. Then
a moan, then
a howl and a
shriek arose
which reached
from group to
group, from
house to house,
from square to forest. Human and
animal cries blended in one piteous
appeal for mercy.</p>

<p>Again the unknown power smote the
lad to the earth, which had become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a raging sea. It rocked&mdash;it rolled.
Terrified, the child no longer attempted
to stand. He got down on his hands
and knees and crawled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs11.jpg" width="500" height="455" alt="&quot;BIRDS SEEMED TO SING THROUGH THE AIR.&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>The trees whistled overhead. Flocks
of birds seemed to sing through the air,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
striking against the telegraph wires.
The atmosphere, which but a few moments
ago reeked with heat, took on a
grave-like chill. Again the earth heaved
and swayed beneath the frightened
youngster, who fell upon his face, vainly
clawing the ground for the support
which it denied him.</p>

<p>The station was only twenty yards
away. There, all the people were in a
turmoil. While endeavoring to regain
their feet, some were violently thrown
upon the wooden platform. Others,
holding to the side of the building, felt
with stupefaction the boards totter beneath
their touch. Was judgment at
hand? Had the end of the world come?
The terror of a nameless danger unmanned
the stoutest heart. Women shrieked
and prayed. Men cursed and groaned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Donny had now joined the stricken
group. They huddled together until
another shock threw them one upon
another. Delicate women became nauseated
as if in mid-ocean. Sturdy men
who had faced bullets in the Civil War
without wincing, lost self-control. They
surged; they fought; they comforted
each other; they cried aloud.</p>

<p>At this moment a frightful tremor
shook the earth. The station building
gave sickening creaks; then it toppled
with a crash.</p>

<p>Yell now followed yell. The crowd,
that but now waited the joyous greetings
of friends, was battered by the
bruises of the earth and hurried by
fright into a contagious state of mania.
The bodies and faces of the people
changed almost beyond recognition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Maddened with fear, stunned by the last
concussion, they stampeded.</p>

<p>The cry rang from mouth to mouth:
"To the woods! To the hill! Home!
Home!! Home!!!" They swayed;
they rushed; they parted; they ran.
Struck as by an invisible enemy, they
fell prostrate in the powdery dust.
They picked themselves up again and
panted in their flight. A voice close to
Donny's side rang above the uproar:
"Good Lord! <i>It is an earthquake!</i>"</p><br /></td>

<span class="caption">&quot;THE PAUPER DOG.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Like birds before a tornado, the people
scattered to the right, to the left,&mdash;this
way, that, and were gone. Donny
found himself, dazed and alone, upon
the cross-ties, groping toward the oncoming
train. He thrust out his hands
and stood a moment piteously crying,
"Pap&auml;! Pap&auml;!" the most bewildered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
little fellow in all that frightened
town.</p>


<p>To crawl up the track, to meet the
train, to board her, to shriek at her,
to get to his
father, to cling
to the cow-catcher,
perhaps,
till the engineer
stopped for sheer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mercy,&mdash;this was the nearest approach
to a purpose that the child had, as he
beat along the track,
stumbling, falling,
up again, down
again, shaken by
the rolling earth,
and blinded by
darkness more awful
than he had ever
seen or thought of.</p>

<p>A strange, thin
dog, without a collar,
whined at his
feet as he pushed
on, and licked his
hand and followed
him like his own.
Huge, dim forms rushed alongside the
embankment, making unearthly sounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Dragons could not have seemed more
dreadful; but they were only cows.
Huge pine-trees bent to the earth with
rapid, vibratory motion as if a giant's
hand clutched and shook them by the
roots.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;THEY WERE ONLY COWS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>All the time the awful rumbling of
the earth went on; it sounded as if the
world were turning herself over, and
thrashing to and fro in a fit of anger;
before every convulsion she uttered a
roar which seemed as if it came from a
metal ball bowled along a giant alley
beneath. It reached its climax by trilling
the letter <b><i>R-r-r-r-r!</i></b> in a mighty
voice. Then came the shock.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the child was making
his way through the horror and desolation
of this scene, he felt himself clasped
in the outstretched arms of a figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
hurrying from the opposite direction.
The two came together in the dark
with a jolt, and recoiled.</p>

<p>"Goramercy!" said a quavering voice.
It was the speech of the old Negro track-walker,
taking two days to get to his
dying daughter because he could not
afford the railroad ticket that would
have brought him to her in two hours.
Donny recognized the high, cracked,
pathetic tones which had addressed him
at the station.</p>

<p>"De track's busted!" panted the
Negro. "De rails is done gone twist
wid de shakes. Dey lays like er heap
ob corn-shuck in de win' up yander.
Dat ar train don' know hit, an' she'll
go to Day ob Jedgment, an' ebery soul

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, there isn't any town to warn!"
cried Donny. "It's all run off! There
isn't anything left but the earthquake
and me&mdash;and this pup&mdash;and nobody
to do anything&mdash;and my pap&auml;'s aboard
that train! Oh, what shall we do?
What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Run, honey, run!" said the old
man, more hopefully. "Mebbe we'll
head her off some ways or 'nuther.
Run for 't! Run!"</p>

<p>The dirty old black hand clasped the
tender little white one, which nestled
into it gratefully. What it meant at
that awful time not to be alone,&mdash;to
feel a human touch, to know that a
human heart beat beside you,&mdash;one
would have to be in the child's place
to understand.</p>

</div>

<div class='cap'>THE two ran, plunging up the distorted
track which swelled and
shook beneath them, toward the coming
train. As they came abreast of the
second little station, known as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
West End station of Summerville, an
idea shot like hope itself through the
confused brain of the hurrying boy.</div>

<p>"I know where the torpedoes are!"
he cried, shrilly. "The torpedoes they
put down to stop trains! I've seen
'em. I play with the superintendent's
boys sometimes. If I was bigger I
could bu'st open the doors and windows
and find 'em."</p>

<p>"I'se an ole man," shouted the Negro,
"but I'se been a tough one befo' Freedom.
I sole for two thousand dollars

<p>Whirling along, in the dark and the
uproar, the two panting figures rushed
against the little station. It was very
dark. In a lull of the raging earth the
distant whistle of the train could be
distinctly heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"In there!" cried the boy. "There!
<i>There!</i> Oh, don't you think perhaps
my pap&auml; took some <i>other</i> train? Oh,
she's coming! I'll help. I can help.
Oh, the door's too big for me!"</p>

<p>But not too big for the ragged old
arm that felled it down as an axe fells
the last rings of a stricken tree. Not
too big for the remnant of strength in
the once muscular slave. Not too big
for the fiery old heart that trouble and
toil and hunger and loneliness had
never quenched.</p>

<p>The door went down&mdash;glass crashed&mdash;another
door yielded&mdash;two wild figures
fell into the superintendent's private
office. The little one climbed like
a monkey upon a shelf he knew of, and
then the two rushed out of the rocking
building into the resounding air, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which human shrieks smote steadily, as
it was said they did all that awful night.
Again, the whistle
of the train&mdash;near
now&mdash;nearer&mdash;</p>


<p>As the pathetic
couple ran up the
torn and twisted
track, Donny began
to sob aloud; but
all he said was,
"Pap&auml;! Pap&auml;!
Pap&auml;!"</p>

<p>"Gib 'em to me,
sonny," said the
Negro, with the authority
of age and
danger. "I kin run

<span class="caption">&quot;THE OLD MAN SEIZED THE TORPEDOES.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The old man seized the torpedoes,
and rushing away with them, vanished
in the darkness. The unknown, collarless
dog followed him. Donny, sobbing
and calling his father's name, pushed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
as well as he could by himself. As he
ran he tried to say his prayers, but all
he could remember was, "Our Father
who art in heaven."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;THIS COMFORTED THE LAD INCREDIBLY.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then he thought, how soon might
his father on earth be father in heaven,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
too? He could not say that prayer.
The boy, like many an older and wiser
than Donny, only cried instead of praying.
As he ran along in this sad
fashion, something hit against him,
whinnying in the dark. It was Ben
Bow, the horse he had ridden ever since
he was a baby. Now, this comforted
the lad incredibly, to have one of the
family with him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2>III.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE old man and the train were now
face to face. The locomotive came
cautiously, for the shocks had penetrated
far up the road, but too fast&mdash;far
too fast. Where the track had
gone to pieces, a mass of twisted rails
and tossing sleepers and furrowed
earth, a bank&mdash;what is called a high
bank in Southern topography&mdash;raised
itself just in the turn of time to
have sent the derailed train plunging
down.</div>

<p>The old Negro watched the approaching
flare of the head-light as he ran on,
with a grim, defiant eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"I stump ye!" he said aloud. He
shook his trembling, black fist at the
locomotive. Stumbling along, his old
bundle over one shoulder, and the torpedoes
clutched in the other arm, being
thus encumbered&mdash;for it did not occur
to him that he could throw away his
bundle, he was so poor&mdash;he tripped and
fell. His foot caught; it is unknown
in what,&mdash;in a twisted tie, or perhaps
in a crevice of the cracking earth.</p>

<p>When he tried to rise, something
held the hero down. He reached his
whole length forward flat upon the
road-bed, and with great precision and
with a coolness that one cannot think
of now without emotion, he laid one
torpedo on each rail, exactly where it
needs must lie to give the warning
through the crushing wheel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Now for the second time the old man
and the locomotive regarded each other.
Her fiery breath was close upon him.
Above the uproar of the reeling earth
the shriek of the train sounded in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
deafened ears. Once again, the strong,
black fist was clinched in the approaching
monster's face.</p>

<p>"I dare ye!" he cried. "Come on!
I dare ye!" He pulled himself up with
a mighty wrench. But the unknown
power held him. He felt the claws of
the cow-catcher. He gave one low cry:</p>

<p>"Lord, I'd like to got dar an' seen
Juno Soo afore she died&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he closed his eyes, that he
might not see what would happen,
clasped his hands above his gray head,
and gave his manly soul to God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV.</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE anxious and bewildered passengers
heard the snap! snap! of the
torpedoes, and half of them rushed to
the platforms. The engineer signalled
"Down brakes!" and the train, with a
mighty jolt, came to a stop. A heavy
shock shook the night at that instant.
The smell of sulphur was strong in the
chilly air. The engineer got out with a
lantern. The crowd gathered in a moment.
At the brink of the scattered
track, at the very edge of wreck and
death, the train had come to a stand.</div>

<p>"Who did it?" swept from lip to
lip. No one was in sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought we hit a man," said the
engineer, swinging his lantern far out
into the darkness. But no sign, whether
of the dead or of the living, was in
sight,&mdash;nothing except a half-starved,
collarless dog, who sat stupidly upon
the grass, and who did not even wag his
tail when the stoker spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Who saved us? Who saved the
train?"</p>

<p>Ask the disappointed vulture and the
mouth of the muttering earth to tell
you, gentlemen passengers! There is
no other lip to answer.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Yes, there is one; a little, trembling,
ashy lip&mdash;a child's&mdash;scarcely able to
articulate for grief or terror, and pouring
forth confused cries that nobody can
understand. The passengers have left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the train, and are making their way
cautiously homeward down the devastated
road-bed, where the track had
lain. It is hurled now to every point
of the compass in the wild night.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/gs26.jpg" width="192" height="350" alt="&quot;PAP&Auml;! PAP&Auml;!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;PAP&Auml;! PAP&Auml;!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>They come to a halt suddenly, before
a little huddling figure, with its
face hidden in its arms, crouched beside
a crooked rail. An old horse, with
traces hanging and harness a wreck,
stands snorting beside the boy.</p>

<p>"Donny! Donny! Why, my sonny
boy!"</p>

<p>The crowd parts for a thin, white-faced
man,&mdash;the passenger who had
been heard to say upon the way, "My
little son is coming to meet me. I hope
these shocks do not extend to the Summerville
station."</p>

<p>There is one other little wild call,
"Pap&auml;! Pap&auml;!"&mdash;a tremendous effort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to be manly, and not cry before strangers&mdash;and
the boy melts into his
father's arms, and wonders whose tears
they are which
rain upon his
cuddling face.</p>


<p>But who saved
the train? Where
is he? How did
he do it? Who
took that noble
risk? Where is
the hero? Here?</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>, my lad?"</p>

<p>Then Donny
raised his awestruck
face from
his father's quick-beating heart, and
standing among the strangers and the
neighbors, told the story,&mdash;all that he
knew; all that he could tell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I only remembered the torpedoes,
sir. The old man did the rest."</p>

<p>"What old man? Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, the old colored man! Haven't
you seen him? The old colored man
who ran ahead and put them on the
track. <i>He</i> saved the train."</p>

<p>The engineer took his lantern and
silently went back and swung the spot
of fire in the black, cold air. It had
not rained, as we have said, for many
weeks, but his feet splashed into deep
pools and running rivulets, and sank
into crevices and gashes in the trembling
earth.</p>

<p>A few of the passengers followed the
engineer. The locality where the train
stood was examined thoroughly. Again,
the same result,&mdash;no human creature,
dead or living, was to be seen. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
pauper dog sat just where they had left
him. The engineer went up and patted
him. At the touch he fell over&mdash;dead
of fright.</p>

<p>They returned to report what they
had found. As they did so, they called
and shouted into the darkness, seeking
for the brave life that had saved their
own. Only the roar of the earthquake
answered them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">

</div>

<p>"But he <i>must</i> be there!" cried the
lad, "of course he's there. He's a very
shabby old Negro. He is all patches
and his knees and hair stick out. His
hat looked like a coon-skin hat. His
hair is gray hair. He carries a little
bundle on his shoulder. He's a very
strong old Negro. He smashed the
station in like&mdash;like blocks. He was a
slave, and he was so strong he cost two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
thousand dollars. He's going to see
his daughter in Branchville. She's dying.
He's so poor he had to walk from
Charleston all the way. <i>He</i> saved the
train. You just look and you'll find
him."</p>


<p>A mighty shock drowned the boy's
words at this moment, and seemed to
jeer at them. The people huddled together,
and looked into each others'
appalled faces, and no man said a word.
Instinctively they ranged themselves
into a mass, as if united humanity could
defy aroused and raging Nature,&mdash;then
broke, and ran for their homes, and
wives and babes, and whatever fate had
left to them.</p>

<div class='cap'>BUT where is the hero? Who saved
the train? Summerville, to this
day, goes seeking him, and her search
is a vain thing. Will he not break his
long, mysterious silence? Will he not

grateful people? An obscure old Negro,
poor, hungry, and homeless, will he not
accept the proffered reward? Where

<p>Some weeks after the shock of August
31, a section hand, setting a sleeper,
found an old bundle, soiled and wet,
tied to a stick and mouldering in the
ground. He opened it carelessly, and
threw it away, and hardly thought to
mention it to his overseer, who had the
curiosity to pick up the rags and examine
them.</p>

<p>A handkerchief, once red, with polka
spots, contained a ragged flannel shirt
and a stocking-heel tied with a piece of
tape. That was all. This stocking-heel,
evidently the wallet of some poor
traveller, held one silver piece of the
value of ten cents, two coppers, and
a newspaper clipping, old and faded.
It was a copy of the Proclamation
of Emancipation to the Negro slaves of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
America, beginning, "I, Abraham Lincoln,"
and bearing date Eighteen Hundred
